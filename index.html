                            knack for crafting exceptional digital experiences.
                            From sleek, responsive websites to robust web
                            applications with powerful backends â€“ that's where I
                            thrive. But my passion doesn't stop at coding; I
                            also love sharing my knowledge. Teaching frontend
                            development to beginners, both teens and adults, is
                            incredibly fulfilling. There's nothing quite like
                            watching someone's eyes light up when they grasp a
                            complex concept or build their first webpage!
