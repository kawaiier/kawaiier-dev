                <p class="intro">
                    I'm a passionate fullstack web developer with a knack for crafting exceptional digital experiences. From sleek, responsive websites to robust web applications with powerful backends â€“ that's where I thrive. But my passion doesn't stop at coding; I also love sharing my knowledge. Teaching frontend development to beginners, both teens and adults, is incredibly fulfilling. There's nothing quite like watching someone's eyes light up when they grasp a complex concept or build their first webpage!

                    <dt class="question">Can you develop <strong>Telegram bots</strong>?</dt>
                    <dd class="answer">Absolutely! I've successfully built a Telegram bot using Node.js that interfaces with the TRX API. While I can't share specifics due to the project's confidential nature, I can certainly discuss the process and potential applications of bot development for your business needs.</dd>

                    <dt class="question">Have you worked on <strong>website redesign</strong> projects?</dt>
                    <dd class="answer">Indeed, I have! One of my notable projects involved revamping a SaaS platform's design. Working alongside an experienced web designer, we transformed the user interface from its original look to a more modern and user-friendly design. You can see the dramatic improvement by comparing the <a href="https://www.develop.exchange/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">initial design</a> with the <a href="https://www.blocksquare.exchange/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updated version</a>. I've also tackled other redesign projects, including <a href="https://www.grandcapitalgeorgia.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this financial services website</a> and the <a href="https://habitses.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Habitses app website</a>. Each project brings its own unique challenges and opportunities for creative problem-solving.</dd>

                    <dt class="question">Can you build a <strong>database-driven website</strong> with an <strong>admin panel</strong>?</dt>
                    <dd class="answer">Definitely! I specialize in developing comprehensive web solutions that integrate databases and user-friendly admin panels. One of my recent projects was a multilingual <a href="https://www.grandmonetageorgia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currency exchange platform</a>. This full-stack application leverages Node.js and React on the frontend, with MongoDB handling the backend data. The admin panel allows easy content management and real-time updates to exchange rates. This type of setup is perfect for businesses requiring dynamic content and data management capabilities.</dd>

                    <dt class="question">How proficient are you with <strong>React</strong>?</dt>
                    <dd class="answer">I'm continually expanding my React expertise! Currently, I'm deep-diving into advanced React concepts through Josh W Comeau's <a href="https://www.joyofreact.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Joy of React</a> course. This intensive study is significantly enhancing my skills, allowing me to build more efficient, scalable, and maintainable React applications. I'm excited to apply these advanced techniques to create even more powerful and user-friendly web solutions for my clients.</dd>
