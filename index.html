                <p class="intro">
                    Full-stack enthusiast here, addicted to crafting awesome web stuff! From killer websites to slick web apps with top-notch backends â€“ that's my jam. Also, I love teaching frontend to teens and adults who are total newbies in programming. It's super rewarding to see them dive into the tech world!

                <p class="question">Can you develop <strong>Telegram bots</strong>?</p>
                <p class="answer">Absolutely, I've built a Telegram bot using NodeJS to communicate with the TRX API. Unfortunately, as the project is closed-source with restricted access, I can't provide any links.</p>
                <p class="question">Have you worked on <strong>redesign</strong> projects before?</p>
                <p class="answer">Yes, indeed. For one client, I revamped the design of a SaaS. Collaborating with a seasoned web designer, we transformed the stock design. Although the original website was built using VueJS and SCSS, you can see the comparison between the <a href="https://www.develop.exchange/en/" target="_blank">initial design</a> and the <a href="https://www.blocksquare.exchange/en/" target="_blank">updated one</a>. I also worked on <a href="https://www.grandcapitalgeorgia.com/en/" target="_blank">another redesign project</a>, but it might not be as visually striking.<br/>I also have an experience with <a href="https://habitses.app/">Habitses</a> app website</p>
                <p class="question">That seems simple. Can you create a <strong>website</strong> connected to a <strong>database</strong>, editable through an <strong>admin panel</strong>?</p>
                <p class="answer">Absolutely, I have experience developing a comprehensive server-admin-client project. The tech stack included NodeJS and React with MongoDB. This project involved creating a multilanguage <a href="https://www.grandmonetageorgia.com/" target="_blank">exchange website</a> with currency converter.</p>
                <p class="question">Are a <strong>React</strong> pro?</p>
                <p class="answer">I'd say I'm getting there! Currently diving into React through <a href="https://www.joyofreact.com/" target="_blank"> Joy Of React</a> by Josh W Comeau. It's been a game-changer in leveling up my skills.</p>
